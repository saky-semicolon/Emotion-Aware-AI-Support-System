                <li><strong>Evaluation Metrics:</strong> Comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance across different emotion categories is conducted using standard metrics, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Overall correctness of predictions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Precision:</strong> The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Recall:</strong> The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.</li>
                        <li><strong>Confusion Matrix:</strong> Provides a detailed breakdown of correct and incorrect classifications for each emotion class, offering insights into potential misclassifications.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Feature Extraction: Capturing Acoustic Nuances</h3>
            <p class="alignment">To effectively capture the subtle and overt emotional characteristics embedded within speech, the model leverages a set of carefully selected acoustic features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients):</strong> These coefficients encode the power spectrum of speech on a non-linear Mel scale, closely mimicking the human auditory system's perception of sound. They are highly effective in representing the timbre of speech.</li>
                <li><strong>ZCR (Zero Crossing Rate):</strong> This feature quantifies the rate at which the speech signal changes its sign. It is a strong indicator of the noisiness and tonality of the speech, often correlating with the energy and pitch of the utterance.</li>
                <li><strong>RMSE (Root Mean Square Energy):</strong> Represents the short-term energy of the audio signal. It is a crucial feature for indicating the loudness and overall energy of the voice, which can be indicative of emotional intensity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="alignment">These extracted features undergo standardization using a pre-fitted scaler to ensure a consistent input format, which is then fed into the deep learning model for emotion classification.</p>

            <h3>Audio Processing & Chunking: Handling Variable Inputs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Incoming audio inputs are systematically preprocessed and segmented into uniform 5-second chunks. This standardized chunking is vital for consistent model input.</li>
                <li>Each segment is analyzed independently by the emotion recognition model. The predictions from individual chunks are then aggregated, significantly enhancing the overall robustness and temporal consistency of the emotion detection for longer or variable-length audio inputs. This technique effectively mitigates performance degradation often associated with unconstrained audio durations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <img src="medias/evaluation.png" alt="" width="100%">
            <p class="alignment">The accuracy plot demonstrates a clear upward trend for both training and validation datasets over
50 epochs. Initially, the model showed rapid improvement, reaching over 90% accuracy by epoch
15. From epochs 20 to 50, both curves stabilize above 95%, indicating consistent learning with no
significant overfitting. By the final epoch, training accuracy approaches 0.99, and validation
accuracy mirrors this trend closely, demonstrating excellent generalization capability.</p>
